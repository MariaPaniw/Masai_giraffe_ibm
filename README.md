METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION

1. Description of methods used for collection/generation of data: 

In order to assess community composition before, during, and after a severe drought event in DoÃ±ana National Park, 18 permanent plots of 25 m2 were established in November 2007 (two years after the drought) on a gradient of drought impact. The plots were located at three sites (with six plots per site): Raposo, Marquas, and Ojillo. To avoid spatial autocorrelation, all plots were separated by at least 50 m from each other. Species plant cover was estimated from contacts with branches along transects within plots; these contacts were divided into two categories corresponding to living or dead canopy. Relative abundance of each species per plot in years after the extreme drought was calculated as the proportion of their contacts of living canopy relative to the sum of the contacts of living canopy of all species. Similarly, the total vegetation cover per plot was calculated as the summed contacts of living canopy of all species. 


2. Methods for processing the data: 

All data were processed in R

3. Instrument- or software-specific information needed to interpret the data: 

R statistical software, version 4.0.1 (and packages as described in the R scripts)

4. Standards and calibration information, if appropriate: 

5. Environmental/experimental conditions: NA

6. Describe any quality-assurance procedures performed on the data: All R scripts are fully commented and have been checked; all raw data was quality-checked at the study site by data managers.

7. People involved with sample collection, processing, analysis and/or submission: I. Granzow, J. Margalef, M. Angeles PÃ©rez, and T. Quirante, M. Paniw, F. Lloret, E. De la Riva
